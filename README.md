I once dreamt of Indonesia having Nobel Laureate in science (physics, to be exact). The chance might be too slim, considering that it is not only about the rare gift of brilliance, but more about building the proper circumstances for people to immerse themselves in doing science. Let it takes tens of year, or even hundreds, I just want my dream become a reality.

One of things I consider among the first steps in producing future Nobel Laureate is to nurture young scientists, those who are still in their high-school years, through top-quality science competition, like the annual International Physics Olympiad (IPhO). Here, I try to collect problem sets and solutions of previous IPhOs for everyone to study privately. I rewrite them in TeX to produce consistent and beautiful document.
